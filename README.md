# WordleCLI

The classic word game, playable on a **Command Line Interface!**

## Description

This is a low-tech, simple version of the game Wordle! This version is playable on any command line interface.  
Entering "q" at any time quits the program.

## Compilation

If you have difficulties running the game, this is your place to look! This game uses 1 external resource (so far)  
and this will affect compilation!

### Terminal/Command Prompt

1. Ensure all files are present (words.txt, lib/J-Color-5.5.1.jar, etc.)
1. Ensure you are in the root directory of the app
1. Run `javac -cp .:lib/JColor-5.5.1.jar WordleCLI.java` in the terminal/command prompt. This will compile the source code with the dependency.
1. Run `java -cp .:lib/JColor-5.5.1.jar WordleCLI` after to start the game!
